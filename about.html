I'm interested in new technologies, programming languages, human languages, Science, History, beta-testing things… Ok I think I actually love to learn, play with stuffs, and hack them a bit.

I used to be a [Ruby][ruby] ([RoR][ror] & [Sinatra][sinatra]) addict, playing with meta-programmation and reflection.

I currenly work at [Zengularity][zengularity], where I learned (to love) [Scala][scala] with [Play! framework][play], and I now lost myself into Type-safety and Fonctional Programming.

What else can I say? Yes, one thing: one day, I will put a <strike>real</strike> better introduction of myself ☺
